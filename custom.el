;; This is the Aquamacs Preferences file.
;; Add Emacs-Lisp code here that should be executed whenever
;; you start Aquamacs Emacs. If errors occur, Aquamacs will stop
;; evaluating this file and print errors in the *Messages* buffer.
;; Use this file in place of ~/.emacs (which is loaded as well.)

(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
